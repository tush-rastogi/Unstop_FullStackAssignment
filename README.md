# Note : Server is hosted on Render Free Web Service. Web Services on the free instance type are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request.

## This will cause a delay in the response of the first request after a period of inactivity while the instance spins up.
